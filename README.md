System handles bookings for a cinema -  weekend homework from Codeclan

## CodeClan Cinema (CCC (again))

Create a system that handles bookings for our newly built cinema!
It's enough if you can call your methods in pry, don't worry about an interface.

### Your app should have:
  - Customers
    - name
    - funds

  - Films
    - title
    - price

  - Tickets
    - customer_id
    - film_id

### Your app should be able to:
  - Create customers, films and tickets
  - CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) customers, films and tickets.
  - Show which films a customer has booked to see, and see which customers are coming to see one film.
